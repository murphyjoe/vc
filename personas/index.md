# Virtually Connecting Personas

A persona a description of an imaginary person, based on real-world observations and understandings of potential or current users. Personas take journeys within the VC community following [pathways](../pathways/index.md).

We are developing personas to help us think better about how we can support people who participate in Virtually Connecting.

Who are the people we most need in our community? And who is missing?
