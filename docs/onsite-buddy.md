Onsite buddies act as the on-the-ground coordinators for sessions at an event, making sure location and equipment are available, guests attend, and running the hangout at the event during the session.
* Think hard about how many sessions you’re willing to commit to. No more than 1 or 2 sessions per day is a good goal.
* It can be exhausting physically! If you can find or negotiate one location (preferably a room) that is best. If you are lugging all of your equipment from room to room - especially if it is a large convention center or something - well you'd better be in good shape. Don't forget to eat and stay hydrated too.
* Coordinate with virtual buddies and guests possible session times that work for everyone.
* It’s great that everybody wants to play but more than 3–4 onsite people is a problem, especially if they’re mostly men.
* Where possible, help w/blogpost and promotion on social media and your PLN and work colleagues.
* Coordinate with conference organisers to sort rooming/timing.
* Find a good spot to run hangout (not noisy, good internet, wall behind so no one passes by unawares).
  * That great spot you scouted, if not reservable, might be in use when you need it.
  * Escalators bad. Atriums bad. Corners good. Rooms real good.
* It takes more time to set up than you think: Ensure onsite technical setup: internet, power, camera, sound (good external mic, speakers, camera if possible, large screen if big numbers of guests).
* Liaise/coordinate with onsite participants. Make sure they know where/when to meet and what VC is about if they're new. Make sure they know it's a hallway convo NOT presentation
* Liaise/coordinate with virtual buddies (eg, if there are delays or schedule/guest changes). Slack or Twitter DM good for this. Have notifications turned on for Slack on your mobile device and maybe make sure your VB has a cell number for you.
* Ensure onsite participants know and are ok that once on air, everything is recorded and public.
* As appropriate, collaborate with Virtual Buddy(ies) to facilitate the conversation. Particularly if onsite folks talk a lot and don't give virtuals a chance to speak.
* Use social media to encourage engagement, take photos n share them on Twitter w @VConnecting and conf hashtag, and after session, share link to YouTube recording with conference hashtag and guest handles. (can also share YT link or blogpost link before for ppl to watch live).
* Make sure onsite guests get away as needed and aren't guilted into staying longer than they can.
