# Definitions of Radical Hospitality

1. Add definitions here...
> Thank you for including me. The word radical makes me think of margins, people that are at the margins in different ways, maybe people that enjoy the philosophy of virtually connecting but they prefer to stay at the margin and don't participate in any of the session Vconnecting holds. How would VConnecting be hospitable with them? Is there a need to be hospitable at all with them? Maybe could we ask in which way do they want to be invited, involved? Maybe they are too shy or they feel they are not entitle to ask questions, so can VConnecting imagine a way in which their questions could be included? That is one thing I thought. Another thing is what can VConnecting do so that those who can't connect in any way could have access to the recordings, to the conversations, the materials? Submitted by @carolinekuhn

> @CarolineKuhn you ask a good question about those in the margins that want to say in the margins - not everyone wants to be in the spotlight - we have used twitter as our main backchannel, so people can ask questions via twitter - but I wonder if we might want to also look at having a question sheet with our signup sheet ...so people can say, I cannot make the session but would love to hear this persons thoughts on this topic ... All our sessions go on YouTube live, so anyone can lurk, and we encourage people to watch a session or two before joining live, so they get that it isn't a presentation. Submitted by @RJHogue

> In trying to define what radical hospitality is I need to flip the script a bit and talk about what it is not. Hospitality in itself can be pretty bland. If you have ever worked in the hospitality industry you know that there are rules to follow and if you follow the rules well then you are doing all you can and you are offering good hospitality. Greet the customer by name but never call out a single customer in a loud way go to them directly, fold the corners just so, leave the mints on the pillow... etc. But when we choose a modifier like radical with a word like hospitality what does that mean? Does it mean more rules, maybe stricter rules? Is this the kind of hospitality that is meant for the upper crust? Do I get the Radical Hospitality plan if I spend the extra $50 for the Deluxe Super Plus package? If you have been to an amusement park recently you may have noticed that you CAN actually pay extra to skip ahead in line - they often call this the "fast pass". Of course on airlines we pay for every small convenience these days. This kind of hospitality is meant to create power structures and separate people. As @CarolineKuhn mentions above I do think that a BIG part of radical hospitality is about treating people the way that they want to be treated; not the way that some rule book says that good hospitality should be performed. Radical hospitality is not etiquette, it is not Ms. Manners, it is not grammar or syntax. Radical hospitality is a conversation, it is listening, it is speaking with courage, and yes that does cause a particular paradox for lurkers. But I don't think that radical hospitality is immune to paradox. At the same time I think that radical hospitality, especially the kind that VC practices, is hyper-aware of power structures and specifically uses hospitality to give greater power to those who are in positions of less power. While we never mean to upset or disrupt those with greater power we also don't compromise that at its heart this thing is about access for those who do not have it from those who do.

> Great questions @CarolineKuhn and I am wondering about audio and text versions of things...
I really like @rjhogue idea of folks asking questions ahead of time even if they can't or do not want to be in the session live. Have done this in other contexts before but never thought of if for vconnecting.... I am also thinking, though, of the kind of labor it takes a volunteer to be radically hospitable and what @autumm was saying about following rules versus, perhaps embodying that radical hospitality. For me, part of what vconnecting is about, is, is a strong belief in the importance of non-present voices at an event to have space to be heard. When you truly believe that, you do all you can to make their experience as close as possible to ideal for them. But not as a favor. As a belief in their right to be there. Submitted by @BaliMaha

> Is radical a noun or adjectives? Meaning are we providing hospitality to radicals or modifying the degree of hospitality. If that is the case I am going with a 1980's, "That's radical, dude" kind of definition. Could use the science definition as we are a loose group hanging together. Could be the definition of compleness and thoroughness...probably what you are going for but I still want to channel my inner Socal surfer. Submitted by @jgmac1106

1. From [Radical Hospitality](https://www.uua.org/worship/words/sermon/radical-hospitality) by Marilyn Sewell: 

>I speak of radical hospitality today because there is a world out there that needs home, that needs community, and I want us to stretch spiritually, to stretch ourselves open. I know that when we take the risk—yes, of course, we’ll blunder, we’ll make mistakes—believe me, I have blundered more than once—but when we take the risk, our lives will grow so much richer and deeper because we have extended ourselves. Our creativity will blossom, for we will not be stuck with our old assumptions, our narrow ways of perceiving reality. Our world will grow wider and softer and more trusting.
