# Pathway: Invited Onsite Guest

## [Kelly Keynoter](../personas/kelly-keynoter.md)
Kelly takes a path to become an invited onsite guest for a specific VC session at a conference where she's speaking.

### The Ideal Path
1. **Discovery**: Kelly gets an email from a VC volunteer (eg, an onsite buddy or event lead), introducing her to what VC does and asking her if she would be willing to participate in a session.
1. **First Contact**: Kelly emails back saying she'd love to join a session.
1. **Participation**:
   1. Kelly's VC contact works with her to schedule a session at a time that's convenient for her.
   1. Kelly asks a colleague [needs persona] from another organization to join her in the session because she wants to add their voice to the conversation.
   1. Sometime before the session starts, Kelly meets the VC Onsite Buddy who is coordinating her session and learns where it will take place.
   1. Kelly and her colleague arrive in the place the session will take place a few minutes before it starts, and get comfortable for a conversation.
   1. Kelly and her colleague meet any other folks participating in the session onsite, as well as the VC Virtual Buddy coordinating the session.
   1. Kelly has a great coversation with the onsite and virtual participants.
1. **Sustained Participation**: Because Kelly had such a good time at her first VC session, she looks to participate in more, either as a virtual or onsite guest.
1. **Networked Participation**:
   1. Kelly amplifies her VC experience with peers in person and on social media to encourage them to join VC sessions both on site and virtually.
1. **Leadership**: Kelly starts to work with VC to help make it possible to hold sessions at other events Kelly attends or wishes she could.

### Barriers & Solutions
* **Barrier**: Kelly doesn't understand what VC is or why she should do it.
  * **Solution**: Invitations to onsite guests should include information about what VC is and what benefits it brings to participants.
* **Barrier**: Kelly thinks it will take a lot of preparation or time to participate in VC.
  * **Solution**: Invitations to onsite guests should make it clear that no preparation is necessary for sessions. VC volunteers should stress the informality of VC conversations and share examples of what happens in sessions.
* **Barrier**: Kelly can't find the place where the session will take place.
  * **Solution**: VC Onsite Buddies should make clear arrangements with onsite guests about where and when they will meet. VC volunteers might share ways guests can reach them directly (eg, emails, mobile phone numbers, etc).
