## Sandip Pathway
1. Discovery - Sandip heard about Virtually Connecting through a Special Interest Group discussion
2. First Contact - His colleague knew that he could not go to the conference and asked if he would be happy to be a virtual buddy (operate the hangout) during the conference
3. Participation - Sandip needs to fill in the 'Join Us' form to get into the slack channel and then continue planning with his colleague
4. Sustained Participation - Once Sandip is in the Slack channel he will see future conferences and opportunities to participate.
5. Networked Participation - Sandip can promote this session through the SIG and his own networks. He already knows a few people that can not get to the same conference
6. Leadership - Sandip might get funding next year to attend a conference and he could become an onsite buddy. He might also choose to be an event lead for another conference he is interested in. He will know who the Regional Lead is and can chat to them about further opportunities within the community.
