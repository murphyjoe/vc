# Virtually Connecting Pathways

A pathway is a journey that VC participants (represented by [VC personas](../personas/index.md)) take in engaging with our community, from first contact to deeper contribution.

We are developing pathways to help us think better about how we can support people who participate in Virtually Connecting.

What initial, untested pathway does a persona take? How could we improve pathways to make participation and contribution easier?

When we think about pathways, we can think both about the ideal path someone might take, and the barriers they might/do encounter and how we can work to remove those barriers. We imagine pathways that lead people to deeper engagement:
1. Discovery 
1. First Contact 
1. Participation 
1. Sustained Participation 
1. Networked Participation
1. Leadership
